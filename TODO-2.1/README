This directory contains the "TODO" files for various core team members.
This gives interested parties external to the project some idea as
to just what exactly it is that we're doing over here!

If something on one of these lists catches your eye as something you think
you may be able to render valuable assistance with, please!  By all means
send mail to the member owning the list (<name>@FreeBSD.org).  Chances are good
they'll more than appreciate hearing from you.  By the the same token, however,
please do NOT send "when will this be done?" or "yes! please!" sorts of
messages to the core team.  If something is on one of these lists it's
because the team member in question really WANTS to do it and must now simply
wrestle with the demons of time, sleep and hunger in trying to get it
done before the freeze date.  If you want to make anything on any of these
lists go faster, offer to help! :-)  Thanks!
