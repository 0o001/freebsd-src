Update: Wed May 17 07:08:07 PDT 1995
Due:	Before 2.2
Prio:	Medium
Task:	Clean up bsd.port.mk
Status:	(1) is done.

There are a couple of ideas here:

(1) Standardize the pre-* and post-* targets.

(2) Re-think the defaults of the variables.  The "good" Makefiles are
    so terse it's hard to find out how you're supposed to modify it
    unless your port is extremely "standard".

Due:	Sometime in the future
Prio:	Would be great if it worked
Task:	A graphical front-end for making ports

Yes, I know it's a pipe dream...but don't you think it will be great
if you can make a port by just modifying the source, and then giving
that and the original to a tk program, clicking the buttons the rest
of the way?

Due:	If I ever get to it
Prio:	Would be really great
Task:	Write a bestseller "ports for dummies"

...and become rich! :)
