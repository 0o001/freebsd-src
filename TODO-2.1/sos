Update: Wed Apr  5 21:46:44 MET DST 1995
Due:	Before 2.1
Prio:	High
Task:	ata/atapi driver.

Driver for ata3/atapi devices. This is the interface for the newer IDE
CDROM drives. Basically its thought as a replacement for wd.c, but it
won't handle old st506/ESDI drives (use wd.c for that).
Its currently at a state where it can probe the devices, find out their
type (ata/atapi/disk/cdrom), and initialize them proberly. It will also
send atapi packets. Currently it can make a disklabel, and open/close
the tray of my Mitsumi FX400 drive, so the communication is working.

Update: Wed Apr  5 21:46:44 MET DST 1995
Due:	Before 2.1
Prio:	Medium
Task:	Linux binary support.

LKM module for running Linux binaries. Main goal is to run (you guessed
it) DOOM. Its now so far that it'l run bash both static and shared, but
there is still a problem with signal handling/return status.

Update: Wed Apr  5 21:46:44 MET DST 1995
Due:	Before 2.1
Prio:	Medium
Task:	New socksys driver for iBCS2 support

A new socksys implementation for the iBCS2 support. The current one is
overly complex (and it doesn't work right), this should clear up the
situation and actually get us to run WordPerfect..
