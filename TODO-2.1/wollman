Prio:	Medium
Task:	Path MTU Discovery

If this can be done quickly, I'll try to do it.  Otherwise it's a 2.2
task.

Prio:	Medium
Task:	Packet scheduler hooks

The MIT packet-scheduling kernel is going to have an initial public
release sometime soon.  It is probably not reasonable to import the
entire distribution into FreeBSD at this time (although this is a
medium-term goal of mine).  However, it may be possible to incorporate
the hooks which the scheduler has into the rest of the kernel, thus
making it easier for people who get the MIT code to add it into their
systems.  I intend to look into this.

Update:	Fri Apr 07 12:04:45 EDT 1995
Due:	Now
Prio:	High
Task:	Add sysctl hooks to sysconfig, rc.

There needs to be a generic mechanism in sysconfig to say `run these
sysctl -nw commands during boot-up'.
