Update: Thu Apr 27 23:58:46 PDT 1995
Due:	April 29th
Prio:	High
Task:	Run a gcc -Wall on LINT and see what it says
Status: Underway.

Some of the warnings generated may well be the result of true errors.  Go
through the output of this and see which ones are simply poor coding
practice and which ones are actual errors.

Update: Thu Apr 27 23:58:46 PDT 1995
Due:    April 29th
Prio:   High
Task:	Fix mkisofs

Make mkisofs be a little less pathological in its dealings with "non-optional
optional flags" and stop asserting all over the place.

Update:	Thu Apr 27 23:58:46 PDT 1995
Due:    April 30th
Prio:   High
Task:   Figure out what we're going to do with srcs to `libcompat' and the GPL

We need to either draft some words for the 2.0.5 CD saying that they can
get the 2.0R CD for a nice low price (not prohibited by the GPL - it says
only "reasonable costs") if they want the source for libcompat, or we
need to provide it somewhere.

Due:	April 30th
Prio:	High
Task:	Write some scripts for CD-ifying the ports and packages collection

I'm not sure what's involved here, but we need some release tools for
bundling up a `portsdist'.

Due:	April 30th

Due:	April 30th
Prio:	High
Task:	Go through the GNATS database closing off dead bugs

There are bugs still ``open'' in the GNATS database which are no longer
present. Correct the situation.
