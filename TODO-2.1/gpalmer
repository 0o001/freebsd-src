Update: Thu Apr 27 23:58:46 PDT 1995
Due:	April 29th
Prio:	High
Task:	Run a gcc -Wall on LINT and see what it says
Status: Underway.

Some of the warnings generated may well be the result of true errors.  Go
through the output of this and see which ones are simply poor coding
practice and which ones are actual errors.

Make mkisofs be a little less pathological in its dealings with "non-optional

Due:	April 30th

Task:	Write some scripts for CD-ifying the ports and packages collection

I'm not sure what's involved here, but we need some release tools for
bundling up a `portsdist'.

Due:	April 30th
Prio:	High

present. Correct the situation.

Due:	Soonish
Prio:	High
Task:	Firewall related work
Status: open

There is still a lot of work waiting to be done on out firewall
implimentation, particularly on the doc / front end side, and I
have a feeling there may be a lurking bug in there yet.
