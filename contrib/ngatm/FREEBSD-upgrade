This is the user part of the NgATM stuff. Be careful to feed changes
back to the maintainer <harti@freebsd.org>, because the code here is
actually shared with other environments besides FreeBSD.

Import should be done by:

	cvs import \
		-m "Virgin import of NgATM user part X.Y" \
		src/contrib/ngatm BEGEMOT NGATM_X_Y
