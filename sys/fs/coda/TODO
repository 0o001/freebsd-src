OOPS:
	FreeBSD does not fsync!!!

Near term:
	Fix bug in executing/mapping new files.
	cfs_mount bug: interaction with cfs_inactive no cfs_unsave.
	vref/vn_lock == vget except no VXWANT which may be on.
	Review locks: vn_lock/VOP_UNLOCK/lockmgr ...

Medium term:
	Add missing VFS methods.
	Do performance profile.
	Tune hash algorithm used in cfs_subr.
	Make MPSAFE
