     This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE, containing
     significant information discovered after the release. This information
     includes security advisories, as well as news relating to the software
     or documentation that could affect its operation or usability. An
     up-to-date version of this document should always be consulted before
     installing this version of FreeBSD.

     This errata document for FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE will be maintained until
     the release of FreeBSD 4.5-RELEASE.

                                 1 Introduction

   This errata document contains ``late-breaking news'' about FreeBSD
   4.4-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult
   this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that
   may already have been found and fixed.

   Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release
   (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition,
   but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted
   as the ``current errata'' for this release. These other copies of the
   errata are located at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/, plus any sites
   which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

   Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 4-STABLE also contain up-to-date
   copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

   For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see
   http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/ or
   ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/.

                       2 Security Advisories and Notices

   Support for per-user ~/.login_conf files (as documented in login.conf(5))
   has been disabled due to incorect merging of local and global settings.
   This problem will be fixed in future releases.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                          3 System Update Information

   The handling of some types of comments in printcap(5) files is faulty. If
   a comment line ends in :\ (the characters normally used to indicate the
   continuation of a printer definition), the line following the comment will
   be parsed as a part of the previous printer definition.
