>1.1  About FreeBSD</A
></H2
><P
>FreeBSD is an operating system based on 4.4 BSD
  Lite for Intel, AMD, Cyrix or NexGen ``x86'' based PC
  hardware and Compaq (formerly DEC) Alpha computers.  Versions for
  the IA64, PowerPC, and Sparc64 architectures are currently under
  development as well.  FreeBSD works with a
  wide variety of peripherals and configurations and can be
  used for everything from software development to games to Internet Service
  Provision.</P
><P
>This release of FreeBSD contains everything you need to run
  such a system, including full source code for the kernel and all
  utilities in the base distribution.  With the
  source distribution installed, you can literally recompile the entire
  system from scratch with one command, making it ideal for students,
  researchers, or users who simply want to see how it all works.</P
><P
>A large collection of third-party ported software (the
  ``Ports Collection'') is also provided to make it easy
  to obtain and install all your favorite traditional UNIX
  utilities for FreeBSD.  Each
  ``port'' consists of a set of scripts to retrieve,
  configure, build, and install a piece of software, with a single
  command.  Over 5,400 ports, from editors to programming
  languages to graphical applications, make FreeBSD a powerful and
  comprehensive operating environment that extends far beyond what's
  provided by many commercial versions of UNIX.  Most ports are also
  available as pre-compiled ``packages'', which can be
  quickly installed from the installation program.</P

>2  Obtaining FreeBSD</A

>FreeBSD may be obtained in a variety of ways.  This section
  focuses on those ways that are primarily of use for obtaining a
  complete FreeBSD distribution, rather than updating an existing
  installation.</P

>2.1  CDROM and DVD</A
></H2
><P
>FreeBSD -RELEASE distributions may
    be ordered on CDROM or DVD from several publishers.  This is
    frequently the most convenient way to obtain FreeBSD for new
    installations, as it provides a convenient way to quickly
    reinstall the system if necessary.  Some distributions include
    some of the optional, precompiled ``packages'' from the
    FreeBSD Ports Collection.</P

    to begin an installation, as well as the distribution files needed
    for the install process itself.  Some mirrors also contain some of
    the ISO images necessary to create a CDROM of a FreeBSD release.</P
