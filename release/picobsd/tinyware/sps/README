This is a small 'ps' replacement, which uses information available via
sysctl(3) interface (contrary to the 'aps', which requires you to mount
procfs(5) to be able to get exactly the same info, so I think that 'sps'
is superior solution).

When I have some time, I'll add usual switches and other functions that normal
'ps' has...
